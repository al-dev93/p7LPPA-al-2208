# Les petits plats project

A recipe website requires a powerful search algorithm. A text field and a tag system are used to perform the search, and the two can be combined.

Two different algorithms were created and compared using jsben.ch. The display of recipe cards and tag lists is instantly updated based on the search criteria.

The design is created with Bootstrap, and its responsive design ensures use on smartphones and tablets without compromising quality.
